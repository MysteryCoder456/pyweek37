# PyWeek 37

My entry for the PyWeek 37 gamejam.

## Dependencies

- `pygame-ce`
- `pygame_gui`

## Controls

- `W` and `S` to accelerate or decelerate
- `A` and `D` to steer left and right

## Concept

A certain billionaire who owns a certain social media site named after an
alphabet has built certain tunnels to overcome surface road traffic problems.
However, in an attempt to expose that these tunnels are nothing but hype, you
embark on a dangerous journey to demonstrate the "utility" of these tunnels
live on YouTube :O

Avoid the leaky steam pipes left by the tunnel engineers, and test tubes left
from the billionaire's endless experiments from other companies!
